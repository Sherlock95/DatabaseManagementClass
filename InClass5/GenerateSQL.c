// Assignment: 
//  Given a .txt file with information. Generate an .sql file with
//      commands that will drop the tables Student, Faculty, Class, and Enroll
//      if they exist and then create those tables. After the tables are
//      created, we are to populate each table with data given in the .txt file.
//
// Assumptions:
//  Since the information and the file is given, I can assume it to be static.
//      - if statements should not be required.
//      - very straightforward code.
//      - file is in same directory as executable.
//
//  Will approach this planning on working on the data in bulk.
//      - Get all lines in file first.
//      - Work on each line.
//          - Grab table name or skip it?
//          - Grab all information into variables or just directly insert
//              data into query?
//      - Again, probably shouldn't need an if statement.

    // Variables go here.
